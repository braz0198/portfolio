            <p>
                Hello there, my name is Jackson. Born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. It is my first year enrolled in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College.
                I took this program hoping to find a good job in the field of digital media and potentially partake in some freelance graphic design work. I have always enjoyed fashion and streetwear. In high school I did a little bit of screen printing and sticker making in a computer technology course. I really enjoyed that aspect of the class and I look forward to developing additional skills to enhance my current knowledge in the realm of design. I enjoy street photography a lot and my favourite form of photography is film. I have an extensive collection of point and shoot and polaroid cameras. I'm hoping to find more medium format cameras, I enjoy using those.
                In my free time I like to skateboard and ride my bicycle around town. I hope that this winter brings some good snowfalls so that I can go snowboarding a lot, as that is also an activity I enjoy doing outside.
            </p>
