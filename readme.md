# My Adobe Portfolio Mock-Up

Objective
For this project, you will use the mockups, wireframes and design elements you create in your User Experience Design course, as a guideline to create your Web Portfolio site. This will be YOUR portfolio. It should reflect who you are and what you can do. It may contain as many or as few pages as you wish, and while it does NOT need to match your mockup exactly, it should be close. Your web portfolio should also contain a collection of work that you have done and wish to share with the world.

Requirements
Create a new repository folder names portfolio
Add your mockup images or PDF files in the images folder 
Your design must be optimized for a variety of browsers, devices and screens sizes.
Your design should strive to meet accessibility standards. This should include semantic markup in logical order, readable text, alternative text on visual elements, and functional using only the keyboard.
Your design should match closely to the your mockup, and should utilize modern layout techniques. While it is encouraged that you use Flexbox or CSS Grid, it is NOT required. You MAY use a modern CSS Framework like Bootstrap or Foundation.
You may use any publicly available CSS libraries or JavaScript plugins.
If you choose to use web fonts, which is encouraged, use only fonts that you have the rights to use.
If you choose to use images, illustrations, videos, or any other asset, use only ones you have the rights to use. No copyrighted materials.
Make sure that any images and illustrations are optimized, and that they respond (grow and shrink) to the layout. You do NOT need to create multiple sizes of your images or utilize picture tag and srcset, sizes, and media attributes. Although it is strongly encouraged.
Create a README.md file and save it in the root of your site. In the readme file add information assuming that you are asked to explain the following about your portfolio in an interview, a brief description on how you created your web portfolio. This should include what challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. Talk about what you learned by creating your web portfolio. Finally, include a list of any assets or resources you used that was not your own, including any frameworks, libraries, plugins, fonts, or images. Use the markdown language to format your README.md file 
Your web portfolio MUST be published to GitHub Pages site. This means going to http://your-username.github.io/portfolio will display your web portfolio.

## About the Project (How you created your web portfolio)

I used the adobe portfolio creator, adding images I composed last semester. I started coding my mock-up by grabbing the cdn version of bootstrap, I am choosing not to reskin for now but might need to come back to it. Starting with all the content and getting the images exported from lightroom correctly with a long edge of 1024 pixels. I realized like you said img-fluid that doesn't make them the correct size, so I'll have to go back and resize them at least once for two sizes per photo. I then added the links for the three collections, then about and contact pages. I hadf troubles throughout the project but overall learned lots about bootstrap.
Break points on Adobe mock up are <540 tablet, <770 desktop
### Challenges Faced 

1. Trying to figure out which breakpoints to use without customizing bootstrap or reskin.
2. Getting the navigation to match using either navbar or nav class
3. How to get the albun covers to appear and then have thew titles hover over them when actvie.

### Overcoming Challenges

1. Using a container xxl to make sure everything is in the right margin, was trying a mix of fluid and xxl; may still come back to it
2. I emailed you and you suggested using the navbar class, yet that brought everythiing in the center so then I had to do some more rearranging, in the end I'm pretty happy with how it turned out
3. I got them in the right areas but still not sure if it would be background image or just image with floating text over? Trying to get that one still.

## What I learned

The different breakpoints of bootstrap and the responsiveness of them. 
The nesting of elements to properly use bootstrap.
More insight with inspector tools
The correct order(syntax symantic???) for classes on bootstrap
Bootstrap is difficult to use not just a simple class naming tool.
I hope to practice more so i can reskin it as that route proved hard for me.
